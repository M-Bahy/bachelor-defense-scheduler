      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We are a team of 6 students from the German University in Cairo who
        have come together to create a website to schedule bachelor defenses.
        Our goal is to make the process of scheduling defenses easier for both
        students and faculty members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is made up of individuals with a diverse set of skills and
        backgrounds, including computer science, engineering, and business. We
        are passionate about technology and excited to bring our expertise to
        this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our website is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus
        on simplicity and functionality. We believe that scheduling bachelor
        defenses should be a stress-free experience, and we hope that our
        platform will help to achieve that goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for considering our website for your scheduling needs. We are
        always looking for ways to improve, so please don't hesitate to reach
        out to us with any feedback or suggestions.
